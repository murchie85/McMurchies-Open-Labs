## Day one 

- What is Python?


- What is Bash/Terminal/CMD




1. Open terminal
2. Create a folder called Naomis_workspace
3. Create a folder called day1
4. Go into the folder and create program hello world


practice 
make a file, delete a file, make a file, open a file edit file,.....


- How do you run python?

- Why do you code in python? What do you use Python for?

- What does an application look like?

3. copy only the line which has `git remote add origin` in it.  
4. On your local machine, (in terminal or command line) cd into your project folder.
5. Run the commands below only once. 


### Run only once per new project  

```
git init 

git add .
git commit -m 'my first commit'

git remote add origin **PUTTHEGITULINHERE**

git push -u origin master

```  
  
### Run anytime you make changes to be saved. 
  

```
git init 

git add .
git commit -m 'my changes listed here'

git push
```

1. Google how to print time in python (find the line of code)
2.  Add it
3. Google how to save to variable (myTime)
4. Change greeting to give the time

# useful notes

## Key commands 



## bash commands 


```shell
cd              # change directory       cd desktop
ls              # List files     ls
pwd             # present working directory (where am I) pwd
mkdir           # make directory mkdir naomisFolder
rm              # remove file    rm hello.py
touch           # make a file    touch hello.py
cp              # copy a b       cp filea.txt fileb.txt
clear           # clear screen   clear
```





### Rules 

When naming a file, program or repo try not use a space

# General Pointers

  

- Don't feel overwhelmed, if it gets too much, go look at something else and come back to it.

- Find a balance of learning that works for you

- Courses are fine, but projects (even small tiny 1 hour ones are THE MOST IMPORTANT)
