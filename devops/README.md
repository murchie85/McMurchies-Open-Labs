## Day in the life of a DevOps Engineer 

## Some thing to say at interview  

- I like DevOps as it focuses on strong engineering ideas like automating things and making them more simple. 

- I think because Devops engineers have to work closely with all teams, to build the end to end pipeline they must also be good with people and timelines - I think this is an exciting challenge and will allow me to learn a lot. 

- I am really interested in DevOps scripting and orchestration because DevOps people think about the big picture. I like to think about the order of things, and automate infrastructure and applications so that development can be smooth for the team and the service smooth for hte customer. 

- I like the idea of infrastructure as code and how it means applying a programmatic way of creating pipelines, infrastructure such as web apps, backends in a more controlled way. 
  
- I also want to learn more about containers such as docker, I can see this is used by many great tech companies and allows them to ship and test applications much faster. 




## Learning/Development Objectives 

- Learn **Scripting**, **bash/shell** ; learn to copy, move files, create folders, delete...run scripts on a timer. Essentially this is Sysdamid knowledge. 
- Learn **Git** (I like **github** the best), this is extremely important. Start uploading things to github.   
- Learn **IAAC** (Infrastructure as Code), first watch some high level videos. IAAC languages include Ansible, Chef,Puppet, Terraform, Cloud formation they all do similar things but for different situations. Ansible and Terraform is the most popular and powerful. 
- Learn Containers , **Docker** and Kubernetes (start with docker, only do kubernetes once you are comfortable with scripting, and a bit of cloud)
- Learn **Cloud**, it's worth doing videos that give you hands on tutorials; this will come with time but cloud is one of the most important stacks to learn at the moment. 
- Learn **CICD tools**, jenkins or github actions are most popular pick this up once you are a bit more happy with scripting. 
- Do **monitoring** much later in your studies once you are more confident  


## Words Terminology 

Google these terms and learn more about them. 

- End to End pipeline
- Delivery pipeline
- IAAC infrastructure as code
- CICD Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment
- Microservices (important to learn the concepts)
- Infrastructure
- Immutable infrastructure
- Continuous Monitoring, Testing
- Shift Left
- Agile 

































# Required technologies 


Linux/Windows/unix/mac scripting (sysadmin)

## works on any windows machine 
- Powershell

## works on any linux/mac machine  

- shell/bash 


- python   



# IAAC Infrasturce as code  (orchastration & environment)

- Ansible
- terraform 
- puppet
- chef
- cloud formation
...


( they look a bit like powershell, and also look a bit like test scripts) 

- key value pairs  
    

# Containers  (envrironments)

Two things you need to know 

- Docker
- Kubernetes (do this much later)


- A way to run applications on any machine 
- universalise it 
- small scale and fast
- easy to ship the app

terms to learn 

- image
- container
- run

# Cloud  (infrasture )



Long term Learning/Development  

- Learn Scripting, this is because

Some thing to say at interview  
tech and mission and how it ties it

- I like DevOps as it focuses on strong engineering ideas like automating things and making them more simple. 
- I think because Devops engineers have to work closely with all teams, to build the end to end pipeline they must also be good with people and timelines - I think this is an exciting challenge and will allow me to learn a lot.

- I like the idea of infrastructure as code and how it means applying a programmatic way of creating pipelines, infrastructure such as web apps, backends in a more controlled way.   
- I also want to learn more about containers such as docker, I can see this is used by many great tech companies and allows them to ship and test applications much faster.
