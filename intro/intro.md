## Tech Role Types
  
This is a breakdown of **ALL THE DIFFERENT KIND OF TECH JOBS** , the different kind of roles, what they entail have a look and let me know which ones suit you! 


## FRONT END DEV 
### £28,000 - £58,000


**"you code the look and feel of websites and mobile apps"**

```
Coding: 50%
Design: 30%
People: 20%
```
![](https://crampete-staticfiles.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/cramcourse/frontend.png)  

 Do you like designing the look and feel of things?   
Such as making websites, user interfaces for apps, understanding and optimising how the customer journey is on the website.   
(example might be. you design a website flow to ensure customers dont' drop off halfway through a loan application)

  
## BACKEND DEV 
### £30,000 - £70,000

**"you code the BRAIN and functionality of websites and mobile apps"**

```
Coding: 50%
Design: 30%
People: 20%
```
  
![](https://yourcreativepeople.com/site/user/images/Josh_Desk_2.jpg)  

 Do you want to code up applications and build things.   
Such as code up  the core functions for apps and websites on phone, computer and tablets.This is the main standard software developer, you will get a requirement from your boss 'I need the app to save the users name to a database and automatically send them an email on registration'.    
Then you go away, work on it, code it up and release it for everyone to use.   
You are much more a problem solver, atttention to detail and usually stick your headphones on and get on with it.

## DevOps Engineer 
### £50,000 - £100,000 
  
**"You automate stuff, script stuff, fix stuff and are highly self-driven and like digital tools."**
  
```  
Coding: 33%
Design: 33%
People: 33%
```

![](https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2018/08/devops-role-3.png)
  

You focus on having a broad (shallow) knowledge of a lot of tool but specific knowledge in 4 or 5 areas that make you valuable.   
You do a lot of scripting and infrastructure work (this means you care more about the system, application performance than the product or application.)  



## PROJECT MANAGER/SCRUM MASTER 
### £52,000 - £76,000

**"you coordinate teams, and help them reach their goals."**
  
```  
Coding: 0%

![](https://3ozxuk3equ8uk744atar6415-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Top-Qualities.jpg)  

 Do you want to be in tech-people space, i.e. project management, scrum master, Ethics in tech etc.   
This is where you have a little bit of tech knowledge but you are applying it ot building new processes and aligning people to values.  
More talking and coordination, less doing and implementing.  
  

## Solutions Architect

Are you interested in learning and producing architectures
Such as doing application,system flow design on things like draw. io or microsoft visio.

![](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-become-a-cloud-engineer.png)  

Do you think you might like doing system maintenance and operations?  
More likely to work additional hours if things break.  
This is learning Cloud and keeping servers up and running, this is like coding but you are automating, optimising and keeping things clean rather than building new things. 

  
## Data Scientist / Business Analyst

(Hands on version of previous, without the need to go to business).   
Do you like Data and AI, same as above but you are more focused on building and solving problems, less about reports.  
You are much more a problem solver, atttention to detail and usually stick your headphones on and get on with it.

```
Coding: 30%

- working with maintaining data storage, HUGE focus on data structure (what type is this row, what size is the data the business needs to keep...legal storage requirements etc)

You code but your main focus is writing/coding up tests for all the applications, systems in the company. You have to think how to break things, how people might have missed and forgotten thing, then build harnesses to protect that from happening. You are very risk averse.

## Project Flow and Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC). 
    
     
- Most people who struggle to find Tech Jobs is because they do not have the professional skills  
- This could be those new to tech, or those who are good at tech but lacking experience in teams with collaboration  
- These skills include:  
    - Knowledgge of Software Development Lifecycle 
    - Knowledge of working on projects
    - Knowledge of how people track their work in projects. 
    - Agile & Scrum fundamentals (mandatory in any modern organisation). 
    
     
One of the main reasons people struggle to find jobs, especially those learning tech and trying to make it into tech jobs is that they do not learn the important professional skills required by every
    
## Agile 

## Professional Language  
  
- T-shaped engineer
- Bell Curve versus the Balanced Scorecard
- Watch plenty of Simon Sinek, Socratica and techworld with nana
- Learn management model uses cases:
   - Spotify Model
   - Agile and scrum
   - Verticle vs Horizontal integration

### Security Analyst    
  
![](https://salarieswiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/information-security-analyst-02.jpg).

### DevOps Engineer  

![](https://techbeacon.com/sites/default/files/styles/social/public/field/image/alex-kotliarskyi-361099.jpg?itok=P1HKi6rc). 
    

**ATTRIBUTES**    
   
- **Lots of things!** 
- Must have soft-Skills but learning is the most important. 
- See's the picture, not just the small bubble a front end dev or operations analyst sees.  
- Deep desire to automate. 
- Jack of all trades *knows a small bit about all roles*. 
- This is because they create the pipeline that stiches all the items together `(i.e. development - > testing -> operations)`.   
- They care about things like `code quality` `monitoring performance` `automating jobs`. 
    
**LANGUAGES AND TECHNOLOGIES**   

- Scripting `python` `bash` `shell` and `powershell`.   
- IAAC such as ansible, terraform, chef, cloud formation - these are all scripts which aren't application code, but code to set up servers, networks, automate moving of files , deleting files etc.  
- Works with containers (Docker and Kubernetes).   
  
**Other Note**  
    
DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY:  

- DevOps engineers sometimes do Sysadmin work 
- DevOps engineers sometimes do operations work  
- Devops engineers (regularily) do cloud work 
  
But it **really** helps to learn as much as you can of all of these (don't aim to be a master, just aim to do what you can). 
  
  
 
## Overlap  
  

Some people in these do jobs do tasks from the other jobs, it really depends on the company.  
Developers use databases, DevOps do Cloud etc.  

   
## Job progression Levels. 
  
A rough outline might look like the following:  

 1. Apprentice
 2. Graduate
 3. Junior
 4. Generalist
 5. Specialist
 6. Senior
 7. Lead
 8. Head
 9. Director   
   
Sometimes people can go from junior to head within five years, sometimes within ten it really depends on the role you pick, the technologies/languages you use, the companies you work at and your maturity as a person.
